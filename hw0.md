# I will Git good!

**What is one benefit of using version control?**  
It helps keep track of all changes to code, so you can go back to earlier versions and safely collaborate with others.

**What is something new you learned about Git this week?**  
I learned how to create and switch branches to organize work before merging into the main project.
